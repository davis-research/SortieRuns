# SortieRuns

This repository is a collection of SORTIE-ND runs that I've completed, including parameter files, resulting outputs, tree maps, and the documents used to generate the parameters in the XML files (Parameters folder). 

## Outputs Folder

The outputs folder files are zipped by month, and the current / last month of runs is unzipped for easy access. No zips are password protected.

## Data for parameters Folder

This folder is a collection of PDF and CSV files that were used to generate initial parameter estimates. They are drawn from a variety of sources and may or may not be helpful in the future.

## Tree Maps

This folder is the tree maps used in pretty much all of the runs created. Early runs used slightly different maps, but for consistency, these maps are the standard. As a rule, I usually just modify existing files instead of starting from scratch and reimporting all parameters and tree maps. 

Of note, these tree maps have the "real" data starting at 0,0 and going through the normal size of the real plot. So, for example, BBBPIPO is 100x100 -- so the real data end at 100,100, and the rest of the points were generated from the existing distribution at the existing density in R.

## Parameter Files Folder

This is where the parameter files exist. The older parameter files are zipped by month, with the most recent runs being in separate folders. In each folder, there is a list of individual parameter files that represent a run type for each plot. There is also an XML file appended with "-batch" that gives SORTIE-ND instructions on the number of times to run each file.
